	abstract = {Matlab, Python and R have all been used successfully in teaching college students fundamentals of mathematics \& statistics. In today’s data driven environment, the study of data through big data analytics is very powerful, especially for the purpose of decision making and using data statistically in this data rich environment. MatLab can be used to teach introductory mathematics such as calculus and statistics. Both Python and R can be used to make decisions involving big data. On the one hand, Python is perfect for teaching introductory statistics in a data rich environment. On the other hand, while R is a little more involved, there are many customizable programs that can make somewhat involved decisions in the context of prepackaged, preprogrammed statistical analysis.},

	abstract = {We describe and compare the programming languages C, MATLAB and Python as teaching languages for engineering students. We distinguish between two distinct phases in the process of converting a given problem into a computer program that can provide a solution: (i) finding an algorithmic solution and (ii) implementing this in a particular programming language. It is argued that it is most important for the understanding of the students to perform the first step whereas the actual implementation in a programming language is of secondary importance for the learning of problem-solving techniques. We therefore suggest to chose a well-structured teaching language that provides a clear and intuitive syntax and allows students to quickly express their algorithms. In our experience in engineering computing we find that MATLAB is much better suited than C for this task but the best choice in terms of clarity and functionality of the language is provided by Python.},

	abstract = {S ARTICLE INFO Programming (including coding, data science, and artificial intelligence) is one of the important top skills for chemical engineering undergraduate students, especially in the current era of Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0). Despite its importance, there is almost no dedicated course for programming in the traditional chemical engineering curriculum in many universities. In this article, a future chemical engineering curriculum that includes a programming course is discussed and its integration into traditional courses is also proposed. This study proposes to use three software i.e., Microsoft Excel, GAMS, and Python to make students comfortable to programming so they can learn further by themselves. A representative case of classic logistics problem is presented as a case study. It is expected that this teaching strategy and the proposed example will improve students’ cognition in programming.},

	abstract = {Machine learning enables computers to address problems by learning from data. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses a hierarchical recombination of features to extract pertinent information and then learn the patterns represented in the data. Over the last eight years, its abilities have increasingly been applied to a wide variety of chemical challenges, from improving computational chemistry to drug and materials design and even synthesis planning. This review aims to explain the concepts of deep learning to chemists from any background and follows this with an overview of the diverse applications demonstrated in the literature. We hope that this will empower the broader chemical community to engage with this burgeoning field and foster the growing movement of deep learning accelerated chemistry.},
